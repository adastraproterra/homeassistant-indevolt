## Step 1: Download the indevolt integration folder

1. Click **Code** > **Download ZIP**.
2. Unzip the ZIP file to your computer.


## Step 2: Locate the HA configuration directory path

- **Home Assistant OS**: The configuration directory is located in `/config`.
- **Home Assistant Container**: You can access the configuration directory by locating the `configuration.yaml` file.

**Tip**: The directory should contain a `configuration.yaml` file.

```
config directory/
└── configuration.yaml
```

## Step 3: Create a custom integration directory

1. Enter the config directory.
2. Create the `custom_components` directory if it does not exist.

```
config directory/
├── custom_components/
└── configuration.yaml
```

**Note**: All custom integrations must be placed under `custom_components`, otherwise HA will not be able to recognize them.


## Step 4: Add the integration file

1. Create the `indevolt` directory in the config directory.
2. Copy all files from the unzipped folder (except `README.md`) into the `indevolt` directory.

Once installed correctly, your configuration directory should look like this:

```
config directory/
└── custom_components/
    └── indevolt/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── config_flow.py
        ├── const.py
        ├── coordinator.py
        ├── entity.py
        ├── indevolt_api.py
        ├── manifest.json
        ├── number.py
        ├── select.py
        ├── sensor.py
        ├── service.yaml
        ├── switch.py
```

## Step 5: Restart Home Assistant
